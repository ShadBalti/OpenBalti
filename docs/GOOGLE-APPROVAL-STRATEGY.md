# Google Publisher Network Approval Strategy
## Complete Implementation Guide for Low Value Content Issue

---

## The Problem: What Google Told Us

> "Your site does not yet meet the criteria of use in the Google publisher network."
> 
> "Make sure your site has unique high quality content and a good user experience"
> 
> "Review: Minimum content requirements, Webmaster quality guidelines for thin content"

**Translation**: Your site has pages that are:
- Too short (under 300 words)
- Too generic (low unique value)
- Lacking author/expert credentials
- Missing original insights or data
- Not demonstrating deep knowledge

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What We Found

OpenBalti actually has:
- ✅ 54 pages (good coverage)
- ✅ Comprehensive dictionary (5,000+ words)
- ✅ Multiple learning resources
- ✅ Blog content
- ✅ Community features

But likely missing:
- ❌ Sufficient depth on some pages
- ❌ Author credentials/bios
- ❌ Original expert content  
- ❌ Data/research backing claims
- ❌ Consistent E-E-A-T signals
